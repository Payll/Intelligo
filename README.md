## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In our team of students, some of us live far from our school, we have an average of one and a half hours of travel time per day by public transport.
After several years of using this type of transport, we asked ourselves the following question: How can we optimise our public transport journey from one place to another? It is from this question that our project "Intelligo" was born.

**Objective:**

- Each place is unique and must meet the requirements of the people.
- To have real time data of public transport.
- To create a meeting place.
- To have continuous feedback from users on possible transport problems.
- Optimise the most frequently used routes thanks to the knowledge of the city.

We have designed a fixed terminal that can display in real time the information needed to meet the above objectives.


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
